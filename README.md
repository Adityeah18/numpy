## ðŸ§  What Youâ€™ll Learn

This tutorial-style notebook covers the **core building blocks** of NumPy:

### âœ… Basics
- What is NumPy and why it's faster than lists
- How to create 1D, 2D, and filled arrays
- Data types: `int32`, `float64`, etc.

### âž• Math Operations
- Element-wise addition, subtraction, multiplication, division
- Squaring elements, sine and cosine functions

### ðŸ§± Array Manipulation
- Reshaping with `.reshape()`
- Vertical (`vstack`) and horizontal stacking (`hstack`)
- Copying arrays properly

### ðŸ§® Linear Algebra
- Matrix multiplication with `np.matmul()`
- Identity matrix and determinant with `np.linalg.det()`

### ðŸ“Š Statistics
- Min, max, sum across arrays
- Axis-specific operations

### ðŸ“‚ File I/O + Boolean Masking
- Loading `.txt` data files with `np.genfromtxt()`
- Filtering values using boolean logic
